## ZeroMail

End-to-end encrypted, distributed, P2P messaging site. To improve privacy it uses a BitMessage-like solution and will not expose the message recipient.

 - Using ECIES for secret exchange, AES256 for message encoding
 - When you first visit the site it adds your public key to your data file and after that anyone able to send message to you
 - Everyone try to decrypt every message, this improves privacy by making it impossible to find the message recipient
 - To reduce per message overhead and increase decryption speed we re-use the AES key, but new IV is generated every time
